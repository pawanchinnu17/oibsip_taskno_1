Iris Flower Classification
Overview
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It utilizes a machine learning approach to predict the correct species based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Iris flower classification is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and serves as an excellent introduction to classification tasks.

Dataset
The dataset employed in this project is the well-known Iris dataset, containing 150 samples. Each sample comprises the four aforementioned features along with the corresponding species label. The data is sourced from Iris Dataset, where you can find additional details about its origin and attributes.

Model
For this classification task, we've implemented a knn classifier. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for its accuracy in predicting Iris species. The knn algorithm is a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing classification decisions.
